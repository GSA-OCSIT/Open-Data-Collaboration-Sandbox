## Background

Plot.ly offers very low barrier of adoption for government agencies who would like to easily visualize important data.  This project seeks to collect a range of very simple recipes for formatted data and plot.ly visualizations that can then automatically represent them.  

## How to Contribute

For the purposes of this project, an important characteristic of plot.ly is the ability to easily consume a hosted data file by merely appending the dataset's URL to a plot.ly URL, e.g. https://plot.ly/external/?url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/open/data/fy12-onward-rib-filed-via-internet.csv.
