## Loose Notes

'The framework is called "impress.js". It's not technically GitHub pages specific, but Pages works well.'

Can also  fork one an existing presentation and clear out the _posts folder.


Re: Accessibility - 'It's semantic HTML. So better than Powerpoint. Disable javascript and take a look. (or view source)'
