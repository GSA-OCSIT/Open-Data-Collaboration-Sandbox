## Loose Notes

The framework is called impress.js. It's not technically GitHub pages specific, but Pages works well.

Can also  fork one an existing presentation and clear out the `_posts` folder.


Re: Accessibility - 'It's semantic HTML. So better than Powerpoint. Disable javascript and take a look. (or view source)'
